# Slack Reconciler

Bridge webservices. Connect Webhooks, format output for slack and send it along its way :tada:

=======

It's set up right now to passthrough github pull-request and issue notifications, find the label actions, and format the response to send it back.

Deploy this to heroku with the button, and put in your slack url. Then it will post issues!

Deploy to heroku!
